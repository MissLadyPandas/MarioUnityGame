# Super Mario Brothers: A Unity Homage

Welcome to "Super Mario Brothers: A Unity Homage," a faithful tribute to the iconic level 1-1 from the original Super Mario Brothers, developed by Katharine Brumback as a part of an Intro To Game Development course.

## Description

This project is a passionate homage to the classic 2D platformer that many of us grew up playing. Here, players take on the role of the beloved plumber, Mario, and navigate through a familiar yet exciting 2D world filled with challenges, power-ups, and enemies. It showcases the application of various game development concepts learned throughout the course.

## Visual and Audio

The game embraces a pixel art aesthetic reminiscent of the original Super Mario Brothers, ensuring a nostalgic trip down memory lane. It features vibrant colors, charming character designs, and iconic level design. The audio style includes catchy, upbeat chiptune music and memorable sound effects, creating a delightful audio-visual experience for players.

## Development

The project was developed using the Unity game engine and took approximately 10 to 30 hours to complete, spread across 30 days. It showcases a short, 30-60 second gameplay experience that can be replayed indefinitely, mirroring the timeless appeal and replayability of the original game.

## Gameplay and Objectives

The primary objective of the game is to navigate each level, defeat enemies, collect coins and power-ups, and reach the flagpole at the end of each stage. This project appeals to both seasoned gamers and novices, offering a sense of accomplishment, excitement, and a healthy dose of nostalgia.
